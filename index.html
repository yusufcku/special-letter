            <p class="cursive">Dear Tasnim,</p>
            <p>Tasnim, im sorry for the long letter, it may be overhweling, so I dont expect you to read it all in one go. You’ve grown, I’ve grown, and we’ve grown alongside each other, and I believe we can continue to grow together. I made a huge mistake, the gravest one of my life, you didn’t deserve to be treated that way, nobody does, especially someone as special as you. I disregarded your feelings and made it seem like they were mere exaggerations. I let my imature ego take me over, and I didn't listen to you, blind to how much I was hurting you. I lost my self, making the mistake of brushing you off and saying it's just a "friend". Deep down I was never aware of it at the time, but now I can't find any reason besides that I was subconsoisly insecure at the time and seeking a sense of validation or something. I’m truly sorry for betraying what we had built. I’m sorry you had to meet that version of me.</p>

            <p>I was immature, careless, and selfish to even see how much I was hurting you. I only saw it after it was all done. I deeply apologize for all the pain I caused you. I’m sorry for ever making you cry, feel hurt, and feel confused. You had every right to feel the way you did.</p>

            <p>I can only imagine the shock, the feeling of thinking someone, one of the people you’re closest to, who you think would never do something and they do it. Your doubts of me, your disappointment, it’s all justified. I just hope in this last year the things I did didn’t cause you further pain or make you doubt, and that you had happy moments. Tasnim, wallah, going forward, I hope we can continue growing emotionally and growing together. I will and want to better understand your feelings, your likes, your dislikes, your habits, your favorites, you. I will always strive to be more thoughtful, more patient, and to really listen—truly listen to you. I will never dismiss your feelings again.</p>

            <p>The us of a year ago isn’t the same as the us now. We’ve both individually grown so much, and I believe that our love has grown too. Over the past year you've helped me spend time working on understanding both myself and us better. You showed me how much deeper love really goes, how mature of a feeling it is. You've healed me, making me no longer that insecure, ego filled, stagnant person, and you continue to fix me. I wish I could and can be there for you in this same way. This past year you and us have shaped my future, my perspective on love, and even my perspective on life. And in every part of it, I see you. We've exposed our most vulnerable, saddest, and regretful parts. I listened to your heartbeat, I saw your face, and I felt your soul which I never thought I would in this world.<p>
                
            <p>I will always want to build a future with you, to grow further with you, to grow old together. I want to get through our problems, our professional life problems, our dissagreements, our little petty fights, our long distance, our struggles, together. And build ourselves, together. Tasnim I never want you and us to feel like our feelings are invalid. Would you be open to continuing this journey together, trying our bests, and seeing where it takes us?</p>

            <p>Even if we can’t be together now, I hope we can still stay in each other’s lives in some way, even if it’s just as acquaintances. You’ve always been not only my soulmate but my best friend. Know that I will always, and only, choose you. I’ll live my life hoping for your forgiveness, and I will always pray for you and your family. I’ll pray that, one day, our paths intertwine, and we can come together better, however and whenever that may be.</p>

            <p>I would rather keep trying with you tasnim, over and over again, forever, than try with anyone else, in any lifetime. You’re worth everything to me, again and again, until the end, and even beyond that. I will continue to work on myself and be the person you deserve. You are the strongest, kindest, and most beautiful person (inside and out) I know and you will continue to inspire me to be better. I will always support you.</p>

            <p>I love you endlessly Tasnim. And that will never change.</p>

            <p class="cursive">With all my love,<br>Yusuf</p>
